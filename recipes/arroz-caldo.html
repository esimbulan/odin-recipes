    <h1>Chicken Arroz Caldo</h1>
    <img src="../images/arroz-caldo.webp" alt="arroz-caldo" height="310" width="310">
    <h3>Arroz caldo is a lugaw (glutinous rice dish) made with chicken and rice. It’s flavored with garlic, onions,
        ginger, fish sauce, and other seasonings. <br>
        Though “arroz caldo” is a Spanish name, the dish’s origins are Filipino — it is an adaptation of a congee that
        was created by Chinese-Filipino immigrants.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 ¼ pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li>5 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce for sprinkling, if desired (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until fragrant,
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, cover, and cook another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir in sweet rice and bring mixture to a boil. Cover and cook for 10
            minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
